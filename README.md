# Sorting Algorithms for Beginners :D

We implement 3 sorting algorithms for integer arrays.

## Bubble Sort

The Bubble Sort algorithm sorts the array in ascending order.

The algorithm is implemented in C.

## Radix Sort

Radix sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm.
It sorts data with integer keys by grouping numbers based on individual digits.
